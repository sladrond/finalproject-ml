# Final project - Machine Learning

## Abstract
In this project we aim to perform exploratory classification on the Fashion MNIST dataset. 
Image classification can be accomplished by a variety of techniques, including SVMs and ANNs, but recent years have seen CNNs as the most popular method. 
The former methods can be problematic because of their long training times and loss of spatial features. 
In our analysis of the Fashion MNIST dataset, we will explore the effectiveness of different image classification techniques with an emphasis on different CNN models. 
The major challenge to overcome in this approach is in the CNNs training, because the hyper-parameters can easily get stuck in local optima. 
This issue can only get solved by carefully tuning the training hyper-parameters. As expected we obtained the best performace out the CNN proposed.
